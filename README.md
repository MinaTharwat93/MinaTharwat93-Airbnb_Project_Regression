# Airbnb Price Prediction and Analysis

This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices based on various features and provide an interactive web application for users to get price estimates and explore data insights. The application leverages a machine learning model and offers exploratory data analysis (EDA) through visualizations.

## Features

The core of this project is a Streamlit web application with the following features:

*   **Page 1: Price Prediction & Information**
    *   **Price Estimation:** Users can input details about an Airbnb listing (e.g., availability, minimum nights, room type, city, review category, host listing category, availability category, distance category, and season) to get a predicted price.
    *   **Airbnb Introduction:** Provides a general overview of Airbnb and its services.
    *   **Interactive Map:** Displays a map related to Airbnb listings in the USA (requires `usa_map.html`).
    *   **Dataset Overview:** Explains the columns used from the Airbnb dataset.
*   **Page 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
    *   **Data Visualization:** Presents various plots and charts to understand the dataset, including:
        *   Uni-variate analysis of numerical and categorical features.
        *   Average price per room type.
        *   Price variation over time and across different seasons.
        *   Correlation between price and availability.
        *   Top 10 neighborhoods with the highest number of listings.
        *   Relationship between minimum nights and room type across seasons.
        *   Distribution of room types across cities.
        *   Correlation heatmap of numerical features.
*   **Machine Learning Model:**
    *   Utilizes a pre-trained `VotingRegressor` model, which likely combines predictions from multiple models (potentially including XGBoost, as hinted in `app1.py`), to estimate listing prices. The model is loaded from the `voting_pipeline_model_py3.dill` file.

## Setup and Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL
    cd <repository_directory>   # Replace <repository_directory> with the cloned folder name
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    It's good practice to create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the virtual environment:
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    *   On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: The model file (`voting_pipeline_model_py3.dill`) was created with specific library versions (e.g., xgboost==1.6.0, dill==0.3.4, scikit-learn==1.0.2, Python 3.8-3.10). If you encounter issues loading the model, ensure your environment is compatible or retrain the model using the Jupyter notebook and your current library versions.*

## How to Run the Application

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can run the Streamlit application using the following command in your terminal (ensure your virtual environment is activated):

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

This will typically open the application in your default web browser.

**Using the Application:**

*   The application will start with a sidebar allowing you to choose between "first page" and "second page".
*   **First Page:**
    *   View the Airbnb introduction and dataset column explanations.
    *   Explore the interactive USA map (if `usa_map.html` is available and correctly configured).
    *   Use the input fields to provide listing details (availability, minimum nights, room type, etc.).
    *   Click the "Make Prediction" button to see the estimated price.
*   **Second Page:**
    *   Browse through the various EDA visualizations and the Python code snippets used to generate them.
    *   Gain insights into data distributions, relationships, and trends within the Airbnb dataset.

## Dataset

This project uses the "AB_US_2023.csv" dataset, which is part of the U.S. Airbnb Open Data available on Kaggle. This dataset contains information on Airbnb listings in various cities across the United States.

*   **Dataset Link:** [U.S. Airbnb Open Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kritikseth/us-airbnb-open-data?select=AB_US_2023.csv)

The `app1.py` script provides an explanation of the columns used from this dataset for the prediction model.

## EDA Visualizations

The second page of the application is dedicated to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), showcasing various insights from the dataset through visualizations. These include:

*   **Uni-variate Analysis:** Histograms and boxplots for numerical features, and bar plots for categorical features to understand their distributions.
*   **Pricing Insights:**
    *   Average price distribution per room type (Pie chart).
    *   Price variation over time, segmented by season (Line plot).
    *   Price trends over time by room type (Line plot).
*   **Availability Analysis:**
    *   Correlation between price and availability (Boxplot, Scatter plot if available in notebook).
    *   Availability by room type (Boxplot).
*   **Location-Based Insights:**
    *   Top 10 neighborhoods with the highest number of listings, broken down by room type (Bar plot).
    *   Distribution of room types across different cities (Stacked bar plot).
*   **Booking Parameters:**
    *   Relationship between minimum nights required and room type, across different seasons (Bar plot).
*   **Feature Correlation:**
    *   A heatmap displaying the correlation matrix for numerical features in the dataset.

Each visualization on the EDA page is accompanied by the Python code snippet used for its generation, offering transparency and reusability.

## Model Training

The machine learning model (`voting_pipeline_model_py3.dill`) used for price prediction is pre-trained. The details of the data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, and evaluation process can be found in the Jupyter notebook: `airbnb-regression-project.ipynb`.

This notebook serves as the backbone for the modeling part of the project, and you can refer to it if you wish to understand or replicate the model training pipeline.
